We find the subword based on Sennrich et al.

We refer these small subword features as hierarchical subword features.

We confirmed that incorporating hierarchical subword features in the encoder consistently improves BLEU scores on the IWSLT evaluation datasets.",

In general, a question can be correctly answered if its query graph is built correctly and the right answer is then retrieved by issuing the query graph against the KG. Therefore, this paper focuses on query graph generation from natural language questions. Existing approaches for query graph generation ignore the semantic structure of a question, resulting in a large number of noisy query graph candidates that undermine prediction accuracies. In this paper, we define six semantic structures from common questions in KGQA and develop a novel Structure-BERT to predict the semantic structure of a question. By doing so, we can first filter out noisy candidate query graphs by the predicted semantic structures, and then rank the remaining candidates with a BERT-based ranking model. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks MetaQA and WebQuestionsSP (WSP) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as compared to state-of-the-arts.",

We learn distributed language representations, which can be used to predict typological properties on a massively multilingual scale. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses of these language embeddings can tell us how language similarities are encoded in NLP models for tasks at different typological levels. The representations are learned in an unsupervised manner alongside tasks at three typological levels: phonology (grapheme-to-phoneme prediction, and phoneme reconstruction), morphology (morphological inflection), and syntax (part-of-speech tagging). We consider more than 800 languages and find significant differences in the language representations encoded, depending on the target task. For instance, although Norwegian Bokmål and Danish are typologically close to one another, they are phonologically distant, which is reflected in their language embeddings growing relatively distant in a phonological task.

In this paper, we first provide empirical evidence that existing NMT systems in fact still have significant problems in properly translating ambiguous words. We then proceed to describe methods, inspired by the word sense disambiguation literature, that model the context of the input word with context-aware word embeddings that help to differentiate the word sense before feeding it into the encoder. Experiments on three language pairs demonstrate that such models improve the performance of NMT systems both in terms of BLEU score and in the accuracy of translating homographs.",

However, manual annotation of these datasets, many of which are based on existing knowledge bases, is costly and not feasible at scale. Additionally, creating augmentation data for commonsense reasoning is challenging because the synthetic questions must be based on real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce GraDA, a graph-based data augmentation framework that synthesizes factual data samples from knowledge graphs for commonsense reasoning datasets. Our framework consists of two steps: first, we train a graph-to-text model to generate questions from graph entities and relations, and second, we use a generator with a GAN loss to generate distractors for the synthetic questions. Our approach has shown improvement in the performance of SocialIQA, CODAH, HellaSwag, and CommonsenseQA and works well for generative tasks like ProtoQA. Furthermore, our results demonstrate an increase in robustness to semantic adversaries when trained with GraDA, and we provide human evaluations of the quality of the synthetic datasets in terms of factuality and answerability. Our work provides compelling evidence and motivates further research into graph-based data augmentation.",

To that end, we propose to formulate the NER subtasks as an entity span sequence generation task, which can be solved by a unified sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) framework. Based on our unified framework, we can leverage the pre-trained Seq2Seq model to solve all three kinds of NER subtasks without the special design of the tagging schema or ways to enumerate spans. We exploit three types of entity representations to linearize entities into a sequence. Our proposed framework is easy-to-implement and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) or near SoTA performance on eight English NER datasets, including two flat NER datasets, three nested NER datasets, and three discontinuous NER datasets.",

These subnetworks are found using magnitude-based pruning. In this paper, we find that the BERT subnetworks have even more potential than these studies have shown. Firstly, we discover that the success of magnitude pruning can be attributed to the preserved pre-training performance, which correlates with the downstream transferability. Inspired by this, we propose to directly optimize the subnetwork structure towards the pre-training objectives, which can better preserve the pre-training performance. Specifically, we train binary masks over model weights on the pre-training tasks, with the aim of preserving the universal transferability of the subnetwork, which is agnostic to any specific downstream tasks. We then fine-tune the subnetworks on the GLUE benchmark and the SQuAD dataset. The results show that, compared with magnitude pruning, mask training can effectively find BERT subnetworks with improved overall performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, our method is also more efficient in searching subnetworks and more advantageous when fine-tuning within a certain range of data scarcity.

This approach yields impressive results on various benchmarks (e.g., 72.7 F1 on SQuAD with only 128 training examples) while maintaining strong performance in high-resource settings.",

Inspired by recent promising results achieved by prompt-learning, this paper proposes a novel prompt-learning based framework for enhancing XNLI. It reformulates the XNLI problem to a masked language modeling problem by constructing cloze-style questions through cross-lingual templates. To enforce correspondence between different languages, the framework augments a new question for every question using a sampled template in another language and then introduces a consistency loss to make the answer probability distribution obtained from the new question as similar as possible with the corresponding distribution obtained from the original question. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that XNLI models enhanced by our proposed framework significantly outperform original ones under both the full-shot and few-shot cross-lingual transfer settings.",

Such performance improvements have motivated researchers to quantify and understand the linguistic information encoded in these representations. In general, researchers quantify the amount of linguistic information through probing, an endeavor which consists of training a supervised model to predict a linguistic property directly from the contextual representations. Unfortunately, this definition of probing has been subject to extensive criticism in the literature, and has been observed to lead to paradoxical and counter-intuitive results. In the theoretical portion of this paper, we take the position that the goal of probing ought to be measuring the amount of inductive bias that the representations encode on a specific task. We further describe a Bayesian framework that operationalizes this goal and allows us to quantify the representations' inductive bias. In the empirical portion of the paper, we apply our framework to a variety of NLP tasks. Our results suggest that our proposed framework alleviates many previous problems found in probing.

Additionally, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of our model through a careful manual examination of a subset of the stories. This analysis has allowed us to understand the key traits of MANN that contribute to its superior performance and to gain insights into how external knowledge is incorporated into the task of ending prediction.",

However, empirical results using CAD during training for OOD generalization have been mixed. To explain this discrepancy, through a toy theoretical example and empirical analysis on two crowdsourced CAD datasets, we show that: (a) while features perturbed in CAD are indeed robust features, it may prevent the model from learning unperturbed robust features; and (b) CAD may exacerbate existing spurious correlations in the data.

We demonstrate how gaze behavior contributes to the prediction of each of these properties and the overall quality by comparing the results obtained from traditional textual features and gaze features for score prediction. Additionally, we hypothesize that gaze behavior during full understanding of the text provides a more accurate indication of the assigned rating compared to partial understanding. Our experiments support this hypothesis by demonstrating a higher level of agreement between the given rating and the predicted rating when the reader has a complete understanding of the text.",

The current Seq2Seq model fails to meet these diverse requirements, by using a general average likelihood as the optimization criteria. As a result, it usually generates safe and commonplace responses, such as `I don't know'. In this paper, we propose two tailored optimization criteria for Seq2Seq to different conversation scenarios, i.e., the maximum generated likelihood for specific-requirement scenario, and the conditional value-at-risk for diverse-requirement scenario.

A standard strategy to construct poisoned data in backdoor attacks is to insert triggers (e.g., rare words) into selected sentences and alter the original label to a target label. This strategy comes with a severe flaw of being easily detected from both the trigger and the label perspectives: the trigger injected, which is usually a rare word, leads to an abnormal natural language expression, and thus can be easily detected by a defense model; the changed target label leads the example to be mistakenly labeled, and thus can be easily detected by manual inspections. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a new strategy to perform textual backdoor attack which does not require an external trigger and the poisoned samples are correctly labeled. The core idea of the proposed strategy is to construct clean-labeled examples, whose labels are correct but can lead to test label changes when fused with the training set. To generate poisoned clean-labeled examples, we propose a sentence generation model based on the genetic algorithm to cater to the non-differentiable characteristic of text data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed attacking strategy is not only effective, but more importantly, hard to defend due to its triggerless and clean-labeled nature.

We argue that this outstanding performance is unlikely to lead to a good model of text coherence, and suggest that the Shuffle Test should be approached in a Zero-Shot setting: models should be evaluated without being trained on the task itself. We evaluate common models in this setting, such as Generative and Bi-directional Transformers, and find that larger architectures achieve high-performance out-of-the-box. Finally, we suggest the k-Block Shuffle Test, a modification of the original by increasing the size of blocks shuffled.

This lexicon was created using a supervised classifier, which utilized a set of data- and resource-driven features, to bootstrap a sample of annotated verbs. We adapt this approach to create a German lexicon of verbal polarity shifters, confirming that the method works for multiple languages. Furthermore, we improve our classification by incorporating cross-lingual information from the English shifter lexicon. This results in a drastic reduction in annotation effort, as we are able to bootstrap a large number of German verbal polarity shifters. Our German lexicon of verbal polarity shifters is publicly available.",

We find that the original Who's Waldo dataset compiled for this task contains a large number of biased samples that are solvable simply by heuristic methods; for instance, in many cases the first name in the sentence corresponds to the largest bounding box, or the sequence of names in the sentence corresponds to an exact left-to-right order in the image.

To enforce models being correct for the correct reasons, we design automated tools to filter and debias the original dataset by ruling out all examples of insufficient context, such as those with no verb or with a long chain of conjunct names in their captions.

Based on GeoQA, we newly annotate 2,518 geometric problems with richer types and greater difficulty to form an augmented benchmark dataset GeoQA+, containing 6,027 problems in training set and 7,528 totally. We further perform data augmentation method to expand the training set to 12,054. Besides, we design a Dual Parallel text Encoder DPE to efficiently encode long and medium-length problem text.

Our study is focused on the ubiquitous setting where a pretrained model is optionally adapted through continued domain-specific pretraining, followed by task-specific finetuning. We establish a suite of tasks across multiple domains to study temporal misalignment in modern NLP systems.

However, previous work has failed to explore the co-attentive multi-modal modeling for visual and text reasoning. In this paper, we systematically explore the efficacy of image and multi-modal Transformers for brain encoding. Extensive experiments on two popular datasets, BOLD5000 and Pereira, provide the following insights.

However, individuals' cognition of social things is not always able to truly reflect the objective. There may be one-sided or biased semantics in their opinions on a claim. The captured evidence correspondingly contains some unobjective and biased evidence fragments, deteriorating task performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view model based on the views of Collective and Individual Cognition (CICD) for interpretable claim verification.

From the view of individual cognition, we select the top-C-C-C articles with high degree of difference and interact with the claim to explore the local key evidence fragments. To weaken the bias of individual cognition-view evidence, we devise inconsistent loss to suppress the divergence between global and local evidence for strengthening the consistent shared evidence between the both.

However, their large memory requirements and high latency pose a significant challenge in resource-constrained scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a joint distillation and quantization approach, where knowledge is transferred from the full-precision teacher model to the low-precision, distilled student model. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that, despite the complexity of generative tasks, we were able to achieve a 16.5x compression ratio in model footprint with minimal performance degradation compared to the full-precision models on multiple summarization and QA datasets. We further pushed the limits of compression to 27.7x, presenting a trade-off between performance and efficiency for pre-trained models in generative tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to effectively distill and quantize sequence-to-sequence pre-trained models for language generation tasks.",

Precisely, each generated sentence is temporally aligned to the corresponding trace sequence through a contrastive learning strategy. Besides, each generated text token is supervised to attend to the correct visual objects under heuristic spatial attention guidance. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our LoopCAG model learns better correspondence among the three modalities (vision, language, and traces) and achieves SOTA performance on trace-controlled image captioning task.

Moreover, most prior work has emphasized bias along a single dimension such as gender or race. In this work, we benchmark multiple NLP models with regards to their fairness and predictive performance across a variety of NLP tasks. In particular, we assess intersectional bias - fairness across multiple demographic dimensions. The results show that while current debiasing strategies fare well in terms of the fairness-accuracy trade-off (generally preserving predictive power in debiased models), they are unable to effectively alleviate bias in downstream tasks.

In particular, there appears to be a partial input bias, i.e., a tendency to assign high-quality scores to translations that are fluent and grammatically correct, even though they do not preserve the meaning of the source. We analyse the partial input bias in further detail and evaluate four approaches to use auxiliary tasks for bias mitigation. Two approaches use additional data to inform and support the main task, while the other two are adversarial, actively discouraging the model from learning the bias. We compare the methods with respect to their ability to reduce the partial input bias while maintaining the overall performance.

Existing automated forecasting studies rely mostly on structured data, such as time-series or event-based knowledge graphs, to help predict future events. In this work, we aim to formulate a task, construct a dataset, and provide benchmarks for developing methods for event forecasting with large volumes of unstructured text data. To simulate the forecasting scenario on temporal news documents, we formulate the problem as a restricted-domain, multiple-choice, question-answering (QA) task. Unlike existing QA tasks, our task limits accessible information, and thus a model has to make a forecasting judgement. To showcase the usefulness of this task formulation, we introduce ForecastQA, a question-answering dataset consisting of 10,392 event forecasting questions, which have been collected and verified via crowdsourcing efforts. We present our experiments on ForecastQA using BERTbased models and find that our best model achieves 61.0% accuracy on the dataset, which still lags behind human performance by about 19%.

In order to bypass the expensive human annotation and achieve the first step towards the ultimate goal of building a universal dialog system, we set out to build a cross-lingual state tracking framework. Specifically, we assume that there exists a source language with dialog belief tracking annotations while the target languages have no annotated dialog data of any form. Then, we pre-train a state tracker for the source language as a teacher, which is able to exploit easy-to-access parallel data. We then distill and transfer its own knowledge to the student state tracker in target languages.

Consequently, it is more challenging to encode the key information sources—relevant contexts and entity types. However, existing methods only implicitly learn to model these critical information sources while being trained for RE. As a result, they suffer the problems of ineffective supervision and uninterpretable model predictions. In contrast, we propose to explicitly teach the model to capture relevant contexts and entity types by supervising and augmenting intermediate steps (SAIS) for RE. Based on a broad spectrum of carefully designed tasks, our proposed SAIS method not only extracts relations of better quality due to more effective supervision, but also retrieves the corresponding supporting evidence more accurately so as to enhance interpretability. By assessing model uncertainty, SAIS further boosts the performance via evidence-based data augmentation and ensemble inference while reducing the computational cost. Eventually, SAIS delivers state-of-the-art RE results on three benchmarks (DocRED, CDR, and GDA) and outperforms the runner-up by 5.04% relatively in F1 score in evidence retrieval on DocRED.",

To address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting during continuous learning and negative knowledge transfer across tasks, we propose the Prefix-guided Lightweight Encoder (PLE), along with three auxiliary strategies: Pseudo Samples Replay, Teacher Knowledge Transfer, and Dynamic Weighting Replay. Our experiments show that our method is effective and efficient in preventing catastrophic forgetting and promoting positive knowledge transfer across tasks.",

We focus on constituency parsing using Role and Reference Grammar (RRG), a theory that has so far been understudied in computational linguistics but that is widely used in typological research, i.e., in particular in the context of low-resource languages. Starting from an existing RRG parser, we propose two strategies for low-resource parsing: first, we extend the parsing model into a cross-lingual parser, exploiting the parallel data in the high-resource language and unsupervised word alignments by providing internal states of the source-language parser to the target-language parser. Second, we adopt self-training, thereby iteratively expanding the training data, starting from the seed, by including the most confident new parses in each round. Both in simulated scenarios and with a real low-resource language (Daakaka), we find substantial and complementary improvements from both self-training and cross-lingual parsing. Moreover, we also experimented with using gloss embeddings in addition to token embeddings in the target language, and this also improves results. Finally, starting from what we have for Daakaka, we also consider parsing a related language (Dalkalaen) where glosses and English translations are available but no annotated trees at all, i.e., a no-resource scenario wrt. syntactic annotations. We start with cross-lingual parser trained on Daakaka with glosses and use self-training to adapt it to Dalkalaen. The results are surprisingly good.",

In addition, existing large-scale PLMs are mainly trained from scratch individually, ignoring that many well-trained PLMs are available. To this end, we explore the question how could existing PLMs benefit training large-scale PLMs in future. Specifically, we introduce a pre-training framework named “knowledge inheritance” (KI) and explore how could knowledge distillation serve as auxiliary supervision during pre-training to efficiently learn larger PLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of KI in training efficiency.

Since the distribution of outlier utterances is arbitrary and unknown in the training stage, existing methods commonly rely on strong assumptions on data distribution such as mixture of Gaussians to make inference, resulting in either complex multi-step training procedures or hand-crafted rules such as confidence threshold selection for outlier detection. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to train an out-of-scope intent classifier in a fully end-to-end manner by simulating the test scenario in training, which requires no assumption on data distribution and no additional post-processing or threshold setting. Specifically, we construct a set of pseudo outliers in the training stage, by generating synthetic outliers using inliner features via self-supervision and sampling out-of-scope sentences from easily available open-domain datasets. The pseudo outliers are used to train a discriminative classifier that can be directly applied to and generalize well on the test task.

To reduce the workload of radiologists, we propose DeltaNet to generate medical reports automatically. Different from typical image captioning approaches that generate reports with an encoder and a decoder, DeltaNet applies a conditional generation process. In particular, given a medical image, DeltaNet employs three steps to generate a report: 1) first retrieving related medical reports, i.e., the historical reports from the same or similar patients; 2) then comparing retrieved images and current image to find the differences; 3) finally generating a new report to accommodate identified differences based on the conditional report. We evaluate DeltaNet on a COVID-19 dataset, where DeltaNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Besides COVID-19, the proposed DeltaNet can be applied to other diseases as well.

However, down-weighting these samples obstructs the model in learning from the non-biased parts of these samples. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose to eliminate spurious correlations in a fine-grained manner from a feature space perspective. Specifically, we introduce Random Fourier Features and weighted re-sampling to decorrelate the dependencies between features to mitigate spurious correlations. After obtaining decorrelated features, we further design a mutual-information-based method to purify them, which forces the model to learn features that are more relevant to tasks.

Existing methods typically 1) treat three modal features (textual, acoustic, visual) equally, without distinguishing the importance of different modalities; and 2) split the video into frames, leading to missing the global acoustic information. In this paper, we propose a global Acoustic feature enhanced Modal-Order-Aware network (AMOA) to address these problems. Firstly, a modal-order-aware network is designed to obtain the multimodal fusion feature. This network integrates the three modalities in a certain order, which makes the modality at the core position matter more. Then, we introduce the global acoustic feature of the whole video into our model. Since the global acoustic feature and multimodal fusion feature originally reside in their own spaces, contrastive learning is further employed to align them before concatenation. Experiments on two public datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models. In addition, we also generalize our model to the sentiment with more complex semantics, such as sarcasm detection.

However, current methods have two shortcomings: they treat the three modal features (textual, acoustic, visual) equally, without considering their varying importance, and they split the video into frames, which results in the loss of global acoustic information. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Acoustic feature enhanced Modal-Order-Aware network (AMOA). Our network is designed to integrate the three modalities in a specific order, giving greater importance to the modality at the core position. We also introduce the global acoustic feature of the entire video into our model. To align the global acoustic feature and the multimodal fusion feature, we employ contrastive learning before concatenating them. Our experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we extend our model to handle more complex sentiments, such as sarcasm detection, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a widely used sarcasm dataset.",

We use a purely syntactic language model to study the significance of sentence structures in both single-domain and cross-domain attribution, i.e. cross-topic and cross-genre attribution. We show that syntax may be helpful for cross-genre attribution while cross-topic attribution and single-domain may benefit from additional lexical information.

To study the role of word choice, we perform attribution by masking all words or specific topic words corresponding to nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Using a single-domain dataset, IMDB1M reviews, we demonstrate the heavy influence of common nouns and proper nouns in attribution, thereby highlighting topic interference. Using cross-domain Guardian10 dataset, we show that some common nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs may help with stylometric attribution as demonstrated by masking topic words corresponding to these parts-of-speech.

In this paper, we propose a Confidence Based Bidirectional Global Context Aware (CBBGCA) training framework for NMT, where the NMT model is jointly trained with an auxiliary conditional masked language model (CMLM). The training consists of two stages: (1) multi-task joint training; (2) confidence based knowledge distillation. At the first stage, by sharing encoder parameters, the NMT model is additionally supervised by the signal from the CMLM decoder that contains bidirectional global contexts. Moreover, at the second stage, using the CMLM as teacher, we further pertinently incorporate bidirectional global context to the NMT model on its unconfidently-predicted target words via knowledge distillation. Experimental results show that our proposed CBBGCA training framework significantly improves the NMT model by +1.02, +1.30 and +0.57 BLEU scores on three large-scale translation datasets, namely WMT'14 English-to-German, WMT'19 Chinese-to-English and WMT'14 English-to-French, respectively.",

Monolingual KD enjoys desirable expandability, which can be further enhanced (when given more computational budget) by combining with the standard KD, a reverse monolingual KD, or enlarging the scale of monolingual data. Extensive analyses demonstrate that these techniques can be used together profitably to further recall the useful information lost in the standard KD. Encouragingly, combining with standard KD, our approach achieves 30.4 and 34.1 BLEU points on the WMT14 English-German and German-English datasets, respectively.

However, this method can result in the loss of important information for translating low-frequency words. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach called monolingual KD. This method trains the NAT student model using external monolingual data, in addition to the bilingual data used to train the AT teacher model. This approach transfers both the knowledge from the bilingual data and the monolingual data to the NAT student model, improving the translation of low-frequency words. Our experiments on eight WMT benchmarks and two advanced NAT models show that monolingual KD consistently outperforms standard KD. Additionally, monolingual KD is scalable and can be further improved by combining it with standard KD, reverse monolingual KD, or increasing the amount of monolingual data.

Further, the effectiveness of fine-tuning is limited by the inclusion of training examples that negatively affect performance. Here we present a general fine-tuning method that we call information gain filtration for improving the overall training efficiency and final performance of language model fine-tuning. We define the information gain of an example as the improvement on a validation metric after training on that example. A secondary learner is then trained to approximate this quantity. During fine-tuning, this learner selects informative examples and skips uninformative ones. We show that our method has consistent improvement across datasets, fine-tuning tasks, and language model architectures. For example, we achieve a median perplexity of 54.0 on a books dataset compared to 57.3 for standard fine-tuning. We present statistical evidence that offers insight into the improvements of our method over standard fine-tuning. The generality of our method leads us to propose a new paradigm for language model fine-tuning — we encourage researchers to release pretrained secondary learners on common corpora to promote efficient and effective fine-tuning, thereby improving the performance and reducing the overall energy footprint of language model fine-tuning.",

We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP).

We extend LRP to the Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data, and during the training process.
