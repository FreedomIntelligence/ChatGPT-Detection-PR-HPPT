Our architecture scales to databases containing thousands of facts whereas contemporary models are limited by how many facts can be encoded.

To this end, we present MPC-BERT, a pre-trained model for MPC understanding that considers learning who says what to whom in a unified model with several elaborated self-supervised tasks. Particularly, these tasks can be generally categorized into (1) interlocutor structure modeling including reply-to utterance recognition, identical speaker searching and pointer consistency distinction, and (2) utterance semantics modeling including masked shared utterance restoration and shared node detection. We evaluate MPC-BERT on three downstream tasks including addressee recognition, speaker identification and response selection.

However, such patterns only consider NPs' head nouns and hence do not fully capture the semantics of NPs. Recently, Hou (2018) created word embeddings (embeddings_PP) to capture associative similarity (i.e., relatedness) between nouns by exploring the syntactic structure of noun phrases. But embeddings_PP only contains word representations for nouns. In this paper, we create new word vectors by combining embeddings_PP with GloVe. This new word embeddings (embeddings_bridging) are a more general lexical knowledge resource for bridging and allow us to represent the meaning of an NP beyond its head easily. We therefore develop a deterministic approach for bridging anaphora resolution, which represents the semantics of an NP based on its head noun and modifications. We show that this simple approach achieves the competitive results compared to the best system in Hou et al. (2013) which explores Markov Logic Networks to model the problem.

The approach is based on a generative Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that models object relations/attributes of the world as latent variables. The CVAE jointly learns a performer that predicts actions and an explainer that gathers commonsense evidence to justify the action. Our results show that compared to a traditional attention-based model, CVAE performs significantly better in both action prediction and justification. Additionally, a human subject study demonstrates that the commonsense evidence gathered by CVAE can effectively communicate with humans, leading to a higher level of common ground between humans and agents.",

In practice, given a generative pretrained language model and some limited ABSA labeled data, we first employ some parameter-efficient approaches to perform the in-domain fine-tuning.

This motivates us to ask a fundamental question: what kind of synthetic data contributes to BT performance?Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we identify two key factors on synthetic data controlling the back-translation NMT performance, which are quality and importance. Furthermore, based on our findings, we propose a simple yet effective method to generate synthetic data to better trade off both factors so as to yield the better performance for BT. We run extensive experiments on WMT14 DE-EN, EN-DE, and RU-EN benchmark tasks. By employing our proposed method to generate synthetic data, our BT model significantly outperforms the standard BT baselines (i.e., beam and sampling based methods for data generation), which proves the effectiveness of our proposed methods.",

This paper presents a word segmentation system for Urdu which uses a Conditional Random Field sequence modeler with orthographic, linguistic and morphological features. Our proposed model automatically learns to predict white space as word boundary as well as Zero Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ) as sub-word boundary. Using a manually annotated corpus, our model achieves F1 score of 0.97 for word boundary identification and 0.85 for sub-word boundary identification tasks. We have made our code and corpus publicly available to make our results reproducible.",

The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10X speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches.",

Pruning methods can significantly reduce the size of a model, but do not result in large speedups compared to distillation methods. However, distillation methods require a large amount of unlabeled data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method, CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers subnetworks that are highly parallelizable and matches the accuracy and latency of distillation methods, without the need for any unlabeled data. Our approach involves jointly pruning coarse-grained modules, such as layers, and fine-grained modules, such as heads and hidden units, using masks of different granularities to control the pruning of each parameter. Additionally, we implement a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi results in models with over 10X speedups with only a small drop in accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches.",

Particularly, to alleviate dependency parsing errors, we design a SynGCN module with rich syntactic knowledge. To capture semantic correlations, we design a SemGCN module with self-attention mechanism.

The orthogonal regularizer encourages the SemGCN to learn semantically correlated words with less overlap for each word.

The problem setting differs from those of the existing methods for IE. First, the extraction can be carried out from long texts to large tables with complex structures. Second, the extraction is entirely data-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. As far as we know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this work, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem. We first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to perform the task. We also develop a new method within the seq2seq approach, exploiting two additional techniques in table generation: table constraint and table relation embeddings. We consider text-to-table as an inverse problem of the well-studied table-to-text, and make use of four existing table-to-text datasets in our experiments on text-to-table. Experimental results show that the vanilla seq2seq model can outperform the baseline methods of using relation extraction and named entity extraction. The results also show that our method can further boost the performances of the vanilla seq2seq model. We further discuss the main challenges of the proposed task.

The residual learning facilitates the flow of information from the distant past, allowing the model to access a wider context and emphasize previously translated words. Our proposed model outperforms a neural machine translation baseline, as well as a memory and self-attention network, on three language pairs. Analysis of the decoder's attention confirms that it captures a wider context and syntactic-like structures.",

We provide a general algorithm for evaluating derivatives of all orders, which has not been previously described in the literature.

They initialize the deep classifier by training over labeled texts; and then alternatively predict unlabeled texts as their pseudo-labels and train the deep classifier over the mixture of labeled and pseudo-labeled texts. Naturally, their performance is largely affected by the accuracy of pseudo-labels for unlabeled texts. Unfortunately, they often suffer from low accuracy because of the margin bias problem caused by the large difference between representation distributions of labels in SSTC. To alleviate this problem, we apply the angular margin loss, and perform Gaussian linear transformation to achieve balanced label angle variances, i.e., the variance of label angles of texts within the same label. More accuracy of predicted pseudo-labels can be achieved by constraining all label angle variances balanced, where they are estimated over both labeled and pseudo-labeled texts during self-training loops. With this insight, we propose a novel SSTC method, namely Semi-Supervised Text Classification with Balanced Deep representation Distributions (S2TC-BDD). To evaluate S2TC-BDD, we compare it against the state-of-the-art SSTC methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of S2TC-BDD, especially when the labeled texts are scarce.",

One of the problematic presumptions with current MRC technologies is that each question is assumed to be answerable by looking at a given text passage. However, to realize human-like language comprehension ability, a machine should also be able to distinguish not-answerable questions (NAQs) from answerable questions. To develop this functionality, a dataset incorporating hard-to-detect NAQs is vital; however, its manual construction would be expensive. This paper proposes a dataset creation method that alters an existing MRC dataset, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset, and describes the resulting dataset. The value of this dataset is likely to increase if each NAQ in the dataset is properly classified with the difficulty of identifying it as an NAQ. This difficulty level would allow researchers to evaluate a machine's NAQ detection performance more precisely. Therefore, we propose a method for automatically assigning difficulty level labels, which measures the similarity between a question and the target text passage. Our NAQ detection experiments demonstrate that the resulting dataset, having difficulty level annotations, is valid and potentially useful in the development of advanced MRC models.",

To address this challenge, we introduce TutorialBank, a publicly available dataset designed to facilitate NLP education and research. Our dataset consists of over 5,600 resources on NLP and related fields such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Information Retrieval (IR), making it the largest manually collected corpus of resources for NLP education, including more than just academic papers. To enhance the accessibility of this dataset, we have created a search engine and a command-line tool, and annotated the corpus with research topics, relevant resources, prerequisite relations among topics, and relevant sub-parts of individual resources, among other annotations. We are excited to release TutorialBank and present several avenues for further research.",

A common solution often resorts to sequence-level knowledge distillation by rebuilding the training dataset through autoregressive generation (hereinafter known as “teacher AG”).

However, in this work, we experimentally reveal that this assumption does not always hold for the text generation tasks like text summarization and story ending generation. To provide a feasible solution to the multimodality problem of NAG, we propose incorporating linguistic structure (Part-of-Speech sequence in particular) into NAG inference instead of relying on teacher AG. More specifically, the proposed POS-constrained Parallel Decoding (POSPD) method aims at providing a specific POS sequence to constrain the NAG model during decoding. Our experiments demonstrate that POSPD consistently improves NAG models on four text generation tasks to a greater extent compared to knowledge distillation.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a “wayward” behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, we find that Seq2Seq pretraining is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it helps NMT models to produce more diverse translations and reduce adequacy-related translation errors. On the other hand, the discrepancies between Seq2Seq pretraining and NMT finetuning limit the translation quality (i.e., domain discrepancy) and induce the over-estimation issue (i.e., objective discrepancy). Based on these observations, we further propose simple and effective strategies, named in-domain pretraining and input adaptation to remedy the domain and objective discrepancies, respectively.

To overcome this, we propose a novel method that utilizes the large-scale pre-trained language model GPT-2 to generate synthetic training data for OSD. Our approach involves training the GPT-2 model in a dual-training setting using the REINFORCE algorithm to produce in-domain, natural, and diverse training samples. Our experiments on the benchmark dataset for OSD demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Most of PLMs follow the default setting of architecture hyper-parameters (e.g., the hidden dimension is a quarter of the intermediate dimension in feed-forward sub-networks) in BERT. Few studies have been conducted to explore the design of architecture hyper-parameters in BERT, especially for the more efficient PLMs with tiny sizes, which are essential for practical deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we adopt the one-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatically search architecture hyper-parameters. Specifically, we carefully design the techniques of one-shot learning and the search space to provide an adaptive and efficient development way of tiny PLMs for various latency constraints. We name our method AutoTinyBERT and evaluate its effectiveness on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. The extensive experiments show that our method outperforms both the SOTA search-based baseline (NAS-BERT) and the SOTA distillation-based methods (such as DistilBERT, TinyBERT, MiniLM, and MobileBERT). In addition, based on the obtained architectures, we propose a more efficient development method that is even faster than the development of a single PLM.

This study presents a new statistical model that incorporates digital signal processing techniques by treating the predictors and response as signals that are related through convolution. This model uses advanced machine learning algorithms to fit latent impulse response functions (IRFs) of any shape. The results of a synthetic experiment demonstrate the successful recovery of true latent IRFs, and the psycholinguistic experiments show that this model provides plausible, replicable, and detailed estimates of temporal dynamics, with improved or comparable prediction quality compared to other widely-used models.",

In CC, the model gradually increases its ability in finding the matching clues between the dialogue context and a response candidate. As for IC, it progressively strengthens the model's ability in identifying the mismatching information between the dialogue context and a response candidate. Empirical studies on three benchmark datasets with three state-of-the-art matching models demonstrate that the proposed learning framework significantly improves the model performance across various evaluation metrics.",

While the indirectness of figurative language warrants speakers to achieve certain pragmatic goals, it is challenging for AI agents to comprehend such idiosyncrasies of human communication. Though sarcasm identification has been a well-explored topic in dialogue analysis, for conversational systems to truly grasp a conversation's innate meaning and generate appropriate responses, simply detecting sarcasm is not enough; it is vital to explain its underlying sarcastic connotation to capture its true essence. In this work, we study the discourse structure of sarcastic conversations and propose a novel task – Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED). Set in a multimodal and code-mixed setting, the task aims to generate natural language explanations of satirical conversations. To this end, we curate WITS, a new dataset to support our task. We propose MAF (Modality Aware Fusion), a multimodal context-aware attention and global information fusion module to capture multimodality and use it to benchmark WITS. The proposed attention module surpasses the traditional multimodal fusion baselines and reports the best performance on almost all metrics.

We use WECHSEL to transfer the English RoBERTa and GPT-2 models to four languages (French, German, Chinese and Swahili). We also study the benefits of our method on very low-resource languages. WECHSEL improves over proposed methods for cross-lingual parameter transfer and outperforms models of comparable size trained from scratch with up to 64x less training effort.

Transformer-based agents acquire a better cross-modal understanding of objects and display strong numerical reasoning ability than non-Transformer-based agents.

We train an initial model on source data and transfer it to a model that can recognize new NE categories in the target data during a subsequent step, when the source data is no longer available. Our solution consists in: (i) to reshape and re-parametrize the output layer of the first learned model to enable the recognition of new NEs; (ii) to leave the rest of the architecture unchanged, such that it is initialized with parameters transferred from the initial model; and (iii) to fine tune the network on the target data. Most importantly, we design a new NER approach based on sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) models, which can intuitively work better in our progressive setting. We compare our approach with a Bidirectional LSTM, which is a strong neural NER model.

Additionally, we introduce a new word similarity calculation method based on the semantic network structure of BabelNet. Our methods are evaluated on the English WSD datasets from SemEval-13 and SemEval-15. The results show that our WSD method significantly outperforms the baseline method and outperforms state-of-the-art WSD systems on the SemEval-13 dataset.

In this paper, we follow Rutherford and Xue (2015) to expand the training data set using the corpus of explicitly-related arguments, by arbitrarily dropping the overtly presented discourse connectives. On the basis, we carry out an experiment of sampling, in which a simple active learning approach is used, so as to take the informative instances for data expansion. The goal is to verify whether the selective use of external data not only reduces the time consumption of retraining but also ensures a better system performance.

Recently, language model-based approaches have become popular as an alternative to traditional expert-designed features for encoding molecules. However, these methods only use a single molecular language for representation learning. To address this limitation, we propose MM-Deacon (multilingual molecular domain embedding analysis via contrastive learning), a multilingual molecular embedding generation approach. MM-Deacon is pre-trained using two different languages, SMILES and IUPAC, on large-scale molecules. We evaluated MM-Deacon on seven molecular property prediction tasks from the MoleculeNet benchmark, zero-shot cross-lingual retrieval, and a drug-drug interaction prediction task. The results demonstrate that MM-Deacon outperforms existing molecular representation learning methods.",

In this work, we study the English BERT family and use two probing techniques to analyze how fine-tuning changes the space.

We confirm this hypothesis with carefully designed experiments on five different NLP tasks. Via these experiments, we also discover an exception to the prevailing wisdom that “fine-tuning always improves performance”.

Two measures are proposed in our model to enhance the performance of CGED. First, the detection and correction of grammatical errors are divided into different stages. In the stage of error detection, the model only outputs the types of grammatical errors so that the tag vocabulary size is significantly reduced compared with other string editing based models. Secondly, the correction of some grammatical errors is converted to the task of masked character inference, which has plenty of training data and mature solutions.

Towards this goal, we investigate if a commonly used language model, BERT, possesses such mathematical abilities and, if so, to what degree. For that, we fine-tune BERT on a popular dataset for word math problems, AQuA-RAT, and conduct several tests to understand learned representations better. Since we teach models trained on natural language to do formal mathematics, we hypothesize that such models would benefit from training on semi-formal steps that explain how math results are derived.

Furthermore, since no golden action sequence is used for training, the agent can be misled by spurious search trajectories that incidentally lead to the correct answer. We propose two modeling advances to address both issues: (1) we reduce the impact of false negative supervision by adopting a pretrained one-hop embedding model to estimate the reward of unobserved facts; (2) we counter the sensitivity to spurious paths of on-policy RL by forcing the agent to explore a diverse set of paths using randomly generated edge masks.

In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of such biases in models trained on social media sessions from platforms like Instagram. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware and model-agnostic debiasing strategy that uses reinforcement learning techniques, without the need for extra resources or annotations beyond a pre-defined set of sensitive triggers commonly used to identify cyberbullying. Our evaluations show that this strategy can reduce the impact of unintended biases while also improving detection performance.",

The experiment results show that syntax-augmented mBERT improves cross-lingual transfer on popular benchmarks, such as PAWS-X and MLQA, by 1.4 and 1.6 points on average across all languages. In the generalized transfer setting, the performance boosted significantly, with 3.9 and 3.1 points on average in PAWS-X and MLQA.",

        "text": "Recently, there has been a massive effort to pre-train multilingual text encoders using large corpora in multiple languages to improve cross-lingual transfer learning. However, the transfer is challenging due to typological differences across languages. Fortunately, language syntax, such as syntactic dependencies, can bridge this gap. Previous research has demonstrated that pre-trained multilingual encoders, such as mBERT, can capture language syntax and enhance cross-lingual transfer. This study shows that providing explicit language syntax and training mBERT with an auxiliary objective to encode universal dependency tree structure further improves cross-lingual transfer. Our experiments on four NLP tasks, including text classification, question answering, named entity recognition, and task-oriented semantic parsing, show that syntax-augmented mBERT significantly improves cross-lingual transfer on popular benchmarks, such as PAWS-X and MLQA.

However, recent research suggests that data order can have a significant impact on the performance of finetuned models for natural language understanding. Hence, we examine the effect of a human-like easy-to-difficult curriculum during finetuning of language models for commonsense reasoning tasks. We use paced curriculum learning to rank data and sample training mini-batches with increasing levels of difficulty from the ranked dataset during finetuning. Further, we investigate the effect of an adaptive curriculum, i.e., the data ranking is dynamically updated during training based on the current state of the learner model. We use a teacher model to measure difficulty of each sample and experiment with three measures based on question answering probability, variability and out-of-distribution. To understand the effectiveness of curriculum learning in various scenarios, we apply it on full model fine-tuning as well as parameter-efficient prompt-tuning settings. Our results show that fixed as well as adaptive curriculum learning significantly improve performance for five commonsense reasoning tasks, i.e., SocialIQA, CosmosQA, CODAH, HellaSwag, WinoGrande in both tuning settings. Further, we find that prioritizing the difficult samples in the tail end of training improves generalization to unseen in-domain data as well as out-of-domain data.

        "text": "Question answering over knowledge graphs is an important problem of interest both commercially and academically. There is substantial interest in the class of natural language questions that can be answered via the lookup of a single fact, driven by the availability of the popular SimpleQuestions dataset. The problem with this dataset, however, is that answer triples are provided from Freebase, which has been defunct for several years. As a result, it is difficult to build “real-world” question answering systems that are operationally deployable. Furthermore, a defunct knowledge graph means that much of the infrastructure for querying, browsing, and manipulating triples no longer exists. To address this problem, we present SimpleDBpediaQA, a new benchmark dataset for simple question answering over knowledge graphs that was created by mapping SimpleQuestions entities and predicates from Freebase to DBpedia. Although this mapping is conceptually straightforward, there are a number of nuances that make the task non-trivial, owing to the different conceptual organizations of the two knowledge graphs. To lay the foundation for future research using this dataset, we leverage recent work to provide simple yet strong baselines with and without neural networks.",

The task of answering questions based on knowledge graphs is a significant problem that has garnered attention in both academic and commercial circles.

To this end, we systematically generate various types of `AddText' attacks for both token and sentence-level rationalization tasks and perform an extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art rationale models across five different tasks. Our experiments reveal that the rationale models promise to improve robustness over AddText attacks while they struggle in certain scenarios–when the rationalizer is sensitive to position bias or lexical choices of attack text.

Our newly generated dataset, which we have made open-source, was analyzed using current language models (lightweight BiLSTM and transformer-based MaChAmP) along with a novel script compression method, resulting in state-of-the-art performance for CA-NER. However, we found that CA-TM from a historical topic model perspective, which is central to Arabic studies, remains a challenging task. This interdisciplinary work lays the foundation for future research on the automatic analysis of CA literature.",

However, current CVAE-based models often generate responses using a single latent variable, which may not be adequate to capture the high variability in responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel model that introduces a sequence of latent variables to condition the generation of each word in the response. The approximate posteriors of these latent variables are augmented with a backward Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), enabling the latent variables to capture the long-term dependencies of future tokens during the generation process. To enhance the training process, we also incorporate an auxiliary objective that predicts the subsequent bag of words.

In this paper, we explore the level dependency and path dependency of the label hierarchy in a generative way for building the knowledge of upper-level labels of current path into lower-level ones, and thus propose a novel PAAM-HiA-T5 model for HTC: a hierarchy-aware T5 model with path-adaptive attention mechanism. Specifically, we generate a multi-level sequential label structure to exploit hierarchical dependency across different levels with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and T5 model. To further improve label dependency prediction within each path, we then propose an original path-adaptive attention mechanism (PAAM) to lead the model to adaptively focus on the path where the currently generated label is located, shielding the noise from other paths.

In this work we propose a neural architecture to increase classification accuracy, especially on low-frequency fine-grained tags.

Existing methods usually select reliable sentences that rely on potential noisy labels, resulting in wrongly selecting many noisy training instances or underutilizing a large amount of valuable training data. This paper proposes a sentence-level DSRE method beyond typical instance selection approaches by preventing samples from falling into the wrong classification space on the feature space. Specifically, a theorem for denoising and the corresponding implementation, named Consensus Enhanced Training Approach (CETA), are proposed in this paper. By training the model with CETA, samples of different classes are separated, and samples of the same class are closely clustered in the feature space. Thus the model can easily establish the robust classification boundary to prevent noisy labels from biasing wrongly labeled samples into the wrong classification space. This process is achieved by enhancing the classification consensus between two discrepant classifiers and does not depend on any potential noisy labels, thus avoiding the above two limitations. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks have demonstrated that CETA significantly outperforms the previous methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results.",

Specifically, we augment the canonical MLE objective for training language models with a regularizer that encodes UID. In experiments on ten languages spanning five language families, we find that using UID regularization consistently improves perplexity in language models, having a larger effect when training data is limited. Moreover, via an analysis of generated sequences, we find that UID-regularized language models have other desirable properties, e.g., they generate text that is more lexically diverse. Our results not only suggest that UID is a reasonable inductive bias for language modeling, but also provide an alternative validation of the UID hypothesis using modern-day NLP tools.",

However, there has been relatively less work on analyzing their ability to generate structured outputs such as graphs. Unlike natural language, graphs have distinct structural and semantic properties in the context of a downstream NLP task, e.g., generating a graph that is connected and acyclic can be attributed to its structural constraints, while the semantics of a graph can refer to how meaningfully an edge represents the relation between two node concepts. In this work, we study pre-trained language models that generate explanation graphs in an end-to-end manner and analyze their ability to learn the structural constraints and semantics of such graphs. We first show that with limited supervision, pre-trained language models often generate graphs that either violate these constraints or are semantically incoherent. Since curating large amount of human-annotated graphs is expensive and tedious, we propose simple yet effective ways of graph perturbations via node and edge edit operations that lead to structurally and semantically positive and negative graphs. Next, we leverage these graphs in different contrastive learning models with Max-Margin and InfoNCE losses. Our methods lead to significant improvements in both structural and semantic accuracy of explanation graphs and also generalize to other similar graph generation tasks. Lastly, we show that human errors are the best negatives for contrastive learning and also that automatically generating more such human-like negative graphs can lead to further improvements.",

In this paper, we investigate the generic overgeneralization effect in pre-trained language models experimentally. We show that pre-trained language models suffer from overgeneralization and tend to treat quantified generic statements such as “all ducks lay eggs” as if they were true generics. Furthermore, we demonstrate how knowledge embedding methods can lessen this effect by injecting factual knowledge about kinds into pre-trained language models. To this end, we source factual knowledge about two types of generics, minority characteristic generics and majority characteristic generics, and inject this knowledge using a knowledge embedding model. Our results show that knowledge injection reduces, but does not eliminate, generic overgeneralization, and that majority characteristic generics of kinds are more susceptible to overgeneralization bias.",

Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e., the proof graph) that emulate the model's logical reasoning process. Currently, these black-box models generate both the proof graph and intermediate inferences within the same model and thus may be unfaithful. In this work, we frame the deductive logical reasoning task by defining three modular components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to the inference reasoning. To test our framework, we propose FaiRR (Faithful and Robust Reasoner) where the above three components are independently modeled by transformers. We observe that FaiRR is robust to novel language perturbations, and is faster at inference than previous works on existing reasoning datasets. Additionally, in contrast to black-box generative models, the errors made by FaiRR are more interpretable due to the modular approach.",

In settings where there is no overlap between the properties that are considered during training and testing, we find that the empirical performance of standard language models drops dramatically. To address this, we study the possibility of fine-tuning language models to explicitly model concepts and their properties. In particular, we train separate concept and property encoders on two types of readily available data: extracted hyponym-hypernym pairs and generic sentences.

The prototypical function of a physical artifact is a type of intuitive knowledge that we use to understand natural language. For example, if someone says, \"She borrowed the book,\" we would assume she intends to read it. Similarly, if someone asks, \"Can I use your knife?\" we would assume they need to cut something. In this paper, we introduce a new NLP task of learning the prototypical uses of human-made physical objects. We use FrameNet frames to represent a set of common functions for objects and present a manually annotated dataset of physical objects labeled with their prototypical functions. Our experimental results include BERT-based models that use masked pattern predictions and artifact sense definitions from WordNet and frame definitions from FrameNet.",

At inference, this modular design allows us to compose the ranker by applying the (re)ranking adapter (or SFTM) trained with source language data together with the language adapter (or SFTM) of a target language. We carry out a large scale evaluation on the CLEF-2003 and HC4 benchmarks and additionally, as another contribution, extend the former with queries in three new languages: Kyrgyz, Uyghur and Turkish.

First, available dialogue datasets related to malevolence are labeled with a single category, but in practice assigning a single category to each utterance may not be appropriate as some malevolent utterances belong to multiple labels. Second, current methods for detecting dialogue malevolence neglect label correlation. Therefore, we propose the task of multi-label dialogue malevolence detection and crowdsource a multi-label dataset, multi-label dialogue malevolence detection (MDMD) for evaluation. We also propose a multi-label malevolence detection model, multi-faceted label correlation enhanced CRF (MCRF), with two label correlation mechanisms, label correlation in taxonomy (LCT) and label correlation in context (LCC). Experiments on MDMD show that our method outperforms the best performing baseline by a large margin, i.e., 16.1%, 11.9%, 12.0%, and 6.1% on precision, recall, F1, and Jaccard score, respectively.",

Nevertheless, most prior work decouples evidence finding from determining the truth value of the claim given the evidence. We propose to consider these two aspects jointly. We develop TwoWingOS (two-wing optimization strategy), a system that, while identifying appropriate evidence for a claim, also determines whether or not the claim is supported by the evidence.

Our CFC model employs a multi-tower architecture to learn dense representations of queries, candidate contexts, and responses through contextual matching. The richer knowledge acquired from the one-tower architecture (fine-grained) is then distilled into the multi-tower architecture (coarse-grained) to enhance the retriever's performance.

Current methods use sequence-to-sequence models with an attention mechanism to determine which parts of the input string the model should concentrate on while generating the output string. Both soft and hard monotonic attention have been applied, but hard non-monotonic attention has only been utilized in other sequence modeling tasks, requiring a stochastic approximation to compute the gradient. In this study, we introduce an exact, polynomial-time algorithm to marginalize over the exponential number of non-monotonic alignments between two strings, demonstrating that hard attention models can be interpreted as neural reparameterizations of the classical IBM Model 1. We conduct experiments comparing soft and hard non-monotonic attention and find that the exact algorithm significantly improves performance over the stochastic approximation and surpasses soft attention.",

The use of emotions and different types of polite tones as needed with facts may enhance the persuasiveness of a message. To incorporate these two aspects, we propose a polite, empathetic persuasive dialogue system (PEPDS). First, in a Reinforcement Learning setting, a Maximum Likelihood Estimation loss based model is fine-tuned by designing an efficient reward function consisting of five different sub rewards viz. Persuasion, Emotion, Politeness-Strategy Consistency, Dialogue-Coherence and Non-repetitiveness. Then, to generate empathetic utterances for non-empathetic ones, an Empathetic transfer model is built upon the RL fine-tuned model. Due to the unavailability of an appropriate dataset, by utilizing the PERSUASIONFORGOOD dataset, we create two datasets, viz. EPP4G and ETP4G. EPP4G is used to train three transformer-based classification models as per persuasiveness, emotion and politeness strategy to achieve respective reward feedbacks. The ETP4G dataset is used to train an empathetic transfer model. Our experimental results demonstrate that PEPDS increases the rate of persuasive responses with emotion and politeness acknowledgement compared to the current state-of-the-art dialogue models, while also enhancing the dialogue's engagement and maintaining the linguistic quality.",

Our approach not only maintains the interpretability of word embeddings, but also has the built-in ability to leverage additional sources of information beyond the input text sequences. Results from extensive testing on several large text datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed.",

To validate our viewpoints, we design two methods to evaluate the robustness of FMS: (1) model disguise attack, which post-trains an inferior PTM with a contrastive objective, and (2) evaluation data selection, which selects a subset of the data points for FMS evaluation based on K-means clustering. Experimental results prove that both methods can successfully make FMS mistakenly judge the transferability of PTMs. Moreover, we find that these two methods can further be combined with the backdoor attack to misguide the FMS to select poisoned models.

For this reason, in this paper we propose fine-tuning an MDS baseline with a reward that balances a reference-based metric such as ROUGE with coverage of the input documents. To implement the approach, we utilize RELAX (Grathwohl et al., 2018), a contemporary gradient estimator which is both low-variance and unbiased, and we fine-tune the baseline in a few-shot style for both stability and computational efficiency. Experimental results over the Multi-News and WCEP MDS datasets show significant improvements of up to +0.95 pp average ROUGE score and +3.17 pp METEOR score over the baseline, and competitive results with the literature.

Our method is motivated by the alignment between segments in the natural language text and Bash command components. Incorporating the structure in the modelling improves the performance of the model. Since such systems must be universally accessible, we benchmark the inference times on a CPU rather than a GPU. We observe a 1.8x improvement in the inference time and a 5x reduction in model parameters. Attribution analysis using Integrated Gradients reveals that the proposed method can capture the problem structure.",

As a typical task of continual learning, continual relation extraction (CRE) aims to extract relations between entities from texts, where the samples of different relations are delivered into the model continuously. Some previous works have proved that storing typical samples of old relations in memory can help the model keep a stable understanding of old relations and avoid forgetting them. However, most methods heavily depend on the memory size in that they simply replay these memorized samples in subsequent tasks. To fully utilize memorized samples, in this paper, we employ relation prototype to extract useful information of each relation. Specifically, the prototype embedding for a specific relation is computed based on memorized samples of this relation, which is collected by K-means algorithm. The prototypes of all observed relations at current learning stage are used to re-initialize a memory network to refine subsequent sample embeddings, which ensures the model's stable understanding on all observed relations when learning a new task.

As a way to evaluate this novel task, we first conducted a systematic study by borrowing the popular ROUGE metric from text-summarization literature and discovered that ROUGE is not suitable for our task. Subsequently, we conducted further human annotations to create 200 document-level and 1,518 sentence-level ground-truth overlap labels.

When researchers pretrain their own models, they often do so under a constrained budget, and the resulting models might underperform significantly compared to SOTA models. These experimental differences led to various inconsistent conclusions about the nature of the cross-lingual ability of these models. To help further research on the topic, we released 10 monolingual byte-level models rigorously pretrained under the same configuration with a large compute budget (equivalent to 420 days on a V100) and corpora that are 4 times larger than the original BERT's. Because they are tokenizer-free, the problem of unseen token embeddings is eliminated, thus allowing researchers to try a wider range of cross-lingual experiments in languages with different scripts. Additionally, we release two models pretrained on non-natural language texts that can be used in sanity-check experiments.

This paper proposes a new approach to dialogue state tracking, referred to as Seq2Seq-DU, which formalizes DST as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Seq2Seq-DU employs two BERT-based encoders to respectively encode the utterances in the dialogue and the descriptions of schemas, an attender to calculate attentions between the utterance embeddings and the schema embeddings, and a decoder to generate pointers to represent the current state of dialogue. Seq2Seq-DU has the following advantages. It can jointly model intents, slots, and slot values; it can leverage the rich representations of utterances and schemas based on BERT; it can effectively deal with categorical and non-categorical slots, and unseen schemas. In addition, Seq2Seq-DU can also be used in the NLU (natural language understanding) module of a dialogue system. Experimental results on benchmark datasets in different settings (SGD, MultiWOZ2.2, MultiWOZ2.1, WOZ2.0, DSTC2, M2M, SNIPS, and ATIS) show that Seq2Seq-DU outperforms the existing methods.",

The paper proposes a new approach, Seq2Seq-DU, which formalizes DST as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Seq2Seq-DU uses two BERT-based encoders to encode the dialogue utterances and schema descriptions, an attender to calculate attention between the utterance and schema embeddings, and a decoder to generate pointers to represent the current dialogue state. The advantages of Seq2Seq-DU include the ability to jointly model intents, slots, and slot values, leverage rich representations of utterances and schemas based on BERT, effectively handle categorical and non-categorical slots, and handle unseen schemas. Seq2Seq-DU can also be used in a dialogue system's natural language understanding module. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (SGD, MultiWOZ2.2, MultiWOZ2.1, WOZ2.0, DSTC2, M2M, SNIPS, and ATIS) show that Seq2Seq-DU outperforms existing methods.",

However, a long article can span several topics and a single summary cannot do justice to all the topics. Further, the interests of readers can vary and the notion of importance can change across them. Existing summarization algorithms generate a single summary and are not capable of generating multiple summaries tuned to the interests of the readers. In this paper, we propose an attention based RNN framework to generate multiple summaries of a single document tuned to different topics of interest. Our method outperforms existing baselines and our results suggest that the attention of generative networks can be successfully biased to look at sentences relevant to a topic and effectively used to generate topic-tuned summaries.",

Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the PAP task in the medicinal product search scenario, including query-title relevance, query intent classification, and named entity recognition in queries.",

Current few-shot NER methods focus on leveraging existing datasets in the rich-resource domains which might fail in a training-from-scratch setting where no source-domain data is used. To tackle training-from-scratch setting, it is crucial to make full use of the annotation information (the boundaries and entity types). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-task (Seed, Expand and Entail) learning framework, SEE-Few, for Few-shot NER without using source domain data. The seeding and expanding modules are responsible for providing as accurate candidate spans as possible for the entailing module. The entailing module reformulates span classification as a textual entailment task, leveraging both the contextual clues and entity type information. All the three modules share the same text encoder and are jointly learned. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets under the training-from-scratch setting show that the proposed method outperformed several state-of-the-art few-shot NER methods with a large margin.

To improve patient assistance, this paper proposes a novel doctor recommendation task to automatically match patients with doctors who have relevant expertise. Unlike prior work in recommendation that mainly focuses on modeling target users based on their past behavior, this study only relies on the limited information in a patient's query for privacy reasons. The joint effects of doctor profiles and previous dialogues with other patients are studied to model doctor expertise, and self-learning is used to explore their interactions. The learned doctor embeddings are then used to estimate their ability to handle a patient query through a multi-head attention mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on a large-scale dataset collected from Chunyu Yisheng, a Chinese online health forum, where it outperforms baselines that only consider doctor profiles and past dialogues.",

While the processes through which children acquire language are by now relatively well understood, a faithful computational operationalisation of the underlying mechanisms is still lacking. Two main cognitive processes are involved in child language acquisition. First, children need to reconstruct the intended meaning of observed utterances, a process called intention reading. Then, they can gradually abstract away from concrete utterances in a process called pattern finding and acquire productive schemata that generalise over form and meaning. In this paper, we introduce a mechanistic model of the intention reading process and its integration with pattern finding capacities. Concretely, we present an agent-based simulation in which an agent learns a grammar that enables them to ask and answer questions about a scene. This involves the reconstruction of queries that correspond to observed questions based on the answer and scene alone, and the generalization of linguistic schemata based on these reconstructed question-query pairs.

        "text": "One of AI's grand challenges is to develop autonomous agents with communication systems that possess the robustness, flexibility, and adaptivity found in human language. Although the processes of child language acquisition are now relatively well understood, a computational implementation of these mechanisms is still lacking. The two main cognitive processes involved in child language acquisition are intention reading and pattern finding. Children must first reconstruct the intended meaning of observed utterances (intention reading), and then gradually abstract away from concrete utterances and acquire productive schemata that generalize form and meaning (pattern finding). In this paper, we introduce a model of the intention reading process and its integration with pattern finding capacities. Our agent-based simulation demonstrates how an agent can learn a grammar that enables it to ask and answer questions about a scene. This involves reconstructing queries based on observed questions and the scene, and generalizing linguistic schemata based on these reconstructed question-query pairs. The result is a productive grammar that can map between natural language questions and queries without ever having observed the queries.",

In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data and a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that weakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model performance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep NER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and weakly labeled data.

We apply the adversarial paradigm to this question, and introduce a new adversarial method of dataset creation for paraphrase identification: the Adversarial Paraphrasing Task (APT), which asks participants to generate semantically equivalent (in the sense of mutually implicative) but lexically and syntactically disparate paraphrases. These sentence pairs can then be used both to test paraphrase identification models (which get barely random accuracy) and then improve their performance.

Our investigation resulted in the following observations: (1) the performance of in-context learning heavily depends on the source of the corpus domain and the size of the pretraining corpus does not necessarily determine its emergence, (2) in-context learning ability can emerge when the language model is trained on a combination of multiple corpora, even if each corpus does not result in in-context learning on its own, (3) pretraining with a corpus related to a downstream task does not always guarantee competitive performance in in-context learning for that task, especially in the few-shot setting, and (4) the relationship between language modeling (as measured by perplexity) and in-context learning is not always correlated, meaning that low perplexity does not always imply high performance in in-context few-shot learning.",

LCQMC is more general than paraphrase corpus as it focuses on intent matching rather than paraphrase. How to collect a large number of question pairs in variant linguistic forms, which may present the same intent, is the key point for such corpus construction.

To support this study, we have created a new publicly available data set of tweets that have been annotated for bragging and its various types. We evaluate different transformer-based models that are infused with linguistic information in two ways: (a) binary bragging classification, which determines if tweets contain bragging statements or not; and (b) multi-class bragging type prediction, which includes the classification of tweets as not bragging. Our results show that our models can predict bragging with a macro F1 score of 72.42 and 35.95 in the binary and multi-class classification tasks, respectively. Finally, we provide a comprehensive linguistic and error analysis of bragging prediction to guide future research in this field.",

As a result, RE still suffers from unintended entity bias, i.e., the spurious correlation between entity mentions (names) and relations. Entity bias can mislead the RE models to extract the relations that do not exist in the text. To combat this issue, some previous work masks the entity mentions to prevent the RE models from over-fitting entity mentions. However, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the semantic information of entities. In this paper, we propose the CoRE (Counterfactual Analysis based Relation Extraction) debiasing method that guides the RE models to focus on the main effects of textual context without losing the entity information. We first construct a causal graph for RE, which models the dependencies between variables in RE models. Then, we propose to conduct counterfactual analysis on our causal graph to distill and mitigate the entity bias, that captures the causal effects of specific entity mentions in each instance. Note that our CoRE method is model-agnostic to debias existing RE systems during inference without changing their training processes.

Image-grounded conversation is thus proposed to address this challenge. Existing works focus on exploring the multimodal dialog models that ground the conversation on a given image. In this paper, we take a step further to study image-grounded conversation under a fully open-ended setting where no paired dialog and image are assumed available. Specifically, we present Maria, a neural conversation agent powered by the visual world experiences which are retrieved from a large-scale image index. Maria consists of three flexible components, i.e., text-to-image retriever, visual concept detector and visual-knowledge-grounded response generator. The retriever aims to retrieve a correlated image to the dialog from an image index, while the visual concept detector extracts rich visual knowledge from the image. Then, the response generator is grounded on the extracted visual knowledge and dialog context to generate the target response. Extensive experiments demonstrate Maria outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics and human evaluation, and can generate informative responses that have some visual commonsense of the physical world.",

For FGET, a key challenge is the low-resource problem — the complex entity type hierarchy makes it difficult to manually label data.

In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual contrastive learning framework to learn FGET models for low-resource languages. Specifically, we use multi-lingual pre-trained language models (PLMs) as the backbone to transfer the typing knowledge from high-resource languages (such as English) to low-resource languages (such as Chinese). Furthermore, we introduce entity-pair-oriented heuristic rules as well as machine translation to obtain cross-lingual distantly-supervised data, and apply cross-lingual contrastive learning on the distantly-supervised data to enhance the backbone PLMs. Experimental results show that by applying our framework, we can easily learn effective FGET models for low-resource languages, even without any language-specific human-labeled data.

Simply extracting more documents increases the number of irrelevant documents, which also degrades the performance of QA systems.

The performance of these QA systems largely depends on the effectiveness of document retrievers, as they must retrieve relevant documents from text corpora to answer questions. However, traditional information retrieval systems often fail to obtain documents with a high probability of containing answers, leading to a decrease in QA system performance. Simply increasing the number of documents can also degrade performance, as it increases the number of irrelevant documents. To address these issues, we introduce the Paragraph Ranker, which ranks paragraphs of retrieved documents to increase answer recall and reduce noise. Our results show that using the Paragraph Ranker to rank paragraphs and aggregate answers improves the performance of open-domain QA pipelines by an average of 7.8% on four open-domain QA datasets.",

In this paper, we argue that relatedness among languages in a language family along the dimension of lexical overlap may be leveraged to overcome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs. We propose Overlap BPE (OBPE), a simple yet effective modification to the BPE vocabulary generation algorithm which enhances overlap across related languages. Through extensive experiments on multiple NLP tasks and datasets, we observe that OBPE generates a vocabulary that increases the representation of LRLs via tokens shared with HRLs. This results in improved zero-shot transfer from related HRLs to LRLs without reducing HRL representation and accuracy. Unlike previous studies that dismissed the importance of token-overlap, we show that in the low-resource related language setting, token overlap matters. Synthetically reducing the overlap to zero can cause as much as a four-fold drop in zero-shot transfer accuracy.",

We contrast a number of strategies, leading to a novel, simple, yet effective method of “similar-language regularization”, where we jointly train on both a LRL of interest and a similar high-resourced language to prevent over-fitting to small LRL data. Experiments demonstrate that massively multilingual models, even without any explicit adaptation, are surprisingly effective, achieving BLEU scores of up to 15.5 with no data from the LRL, and that the proposed similar-language regularization method improves over other adaptation methods by 1.7 BLEU points average over 4 LRL settings.",

However, questions remain about their ability to generalize beyond the small reference sets that are publicly available for research. As an alternative to fitting model parameters directly, we propose a novel method by which a Transformer DL model (GPT-2) pre-trained on general English text is paired with an artificially degraded version of itself (GPT-D), to compute the ratio between these two models' perplexities on language from cognitively healthy and impaired individuals. This technique approaches state-of-the-art performance on text data from a widely used “Cookie Theft” picture description task, and unlike established alternatives also generalizes well to spontaneous conversations. Furthermore, GPT-D generates text with characteristics known to be associated with AD, demonstrating the induction of dementia-related linguistic anomalies.

Previous works have focused on classifying document-level text into fiction and non-fiction genres, while in this work, we deal with shorter texts which are closer to real-world applications like sentiment analysis of tweets. Going beyond simple POS tag ratios proposed in Qureshi et al.(2019) for document-level classification, we extracted multiple linguistically motivated features belonging to four categories: Lexical features, POS ratio features, Syntactic features and Raw features. For the task of short-text classification, a model containing 28 best-features (selected via Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation; RFECV) confers an accuracy jump of 15.56 % over a baseline model consisting of 2 POS-ratio features found effective in previous work (cited above). The efficacy of the above model containing a linguistically motivated feature set also transfers over to another dataset viz, Baby BNC corpus. We also compared the classification accuracy of the logistic regression model with two deep-learning models. A 1D CNN model gives an increase of 2% accuracy over the logistic Regression classifier on both corpora. And the BERT-base-uncased model gives the best classification accuracy of 97% on Brown corpus and 98% on Baby BNC corpus. Although both the deep learning models give better results in terms of classification accuracy, the problem of interpreting these models remains unsolved. In contrast, regression model coefficients revealed that fiction texts tend to have more character-level diversity and have lower lexical density (quantified using content-function word ratios) compared to non-fiction texts. Moreover, subtle differences in word order exist between the two genres, i.e., in fiction texts Verbs precede Adverbs (inter-alia).",

In this work, we show that the strategy of joint learning across multiple languages using a single model performs substantially better than the aforementioned alternatives. We also demonstrate that active learning provides additional, complementary benefits. We show that this simple approach enables the model to be data efficient by allowing it to arbitrate its annotation budget to query languages it is less certain on. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a diverse set of tasks: a classification task with 4 languages, a sequence tagging task with 4 languages and a dependency parsing task with 5 languages.

Since their manual construction is resource- and time-intensive, recent efforts have tried leveraging large pretrained language models (PLMs) to generate additional monolingual knowledge facts for KBs. However, such methods have not been attempted for building and enriching multilingual KBs. Besides wider application, such multilingual KBs can provide richer combined knowledge than monolingual (e.g., English) KBs. Knowledge expressed in different languages may be complementary and unequally distributed: this implies that the knowledge available in high-resource languages can be transferred to low-resource ones. To achieve this, it is crucial to represent multilingual knowledge in a shared/unified space. To this end, we propose a unified representation model, Prix-LM, for multilingual KB construction and completion. We leverage two types of knowledge, monolingual triples and cross-lingual links, extracted from existing multilingual KBs, and tune a multilingual language encoder XLM-R via a causal language modeling objective. Prix-LM integrates useful multilingual and KB-based factual knowledge into a single model.

Across five different test sets, our augmented model shows more robust performance than DPR in both in-domain and zero-shot out-of-domain evaluation.",

However, creating a dataset for each new domain that requires fact verification is a costly process, as it involves manually writing claims and linking them to supporting evidence. To address this challenge, we have developed QACG, a framework for training a robust fact verification model using automatically generated claims derived from evidence found on Wikipedia. QACG generates question-answer pairs from the evidence and converts them into various types of claims. Our experiments on the FEVER dataset demonstrate that QACG significantly reduces the need for human-annotated training data. In a zero-shot scenario, QACG was able to improve the F1 score of a RoBERTa model from 50% to 77%, which is equivalent to the performance achieved with 2K+ manually-curated examples.

Our method was evaluated on standard semantic textual similarity (STS) and semantic search tasks and showed improved performance compared to the base contrastive learned BERTC-C-C and its variants.",

However, previous JointIE models often assume heuristic manually-designed dependency between the task instances and mean-field factorization for the joint distribution of instance labels, thus unable to capture optimal dependencies among instances and labels to improve representation learning and IE performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose to induce a dependency graph among task instances from data to boost representation learning. To better capture dependencies between instance labels, we propose to directly estimate their joint distribution via Conditional Random Fields. Noise Contrastive Estimation is introduced to address the maximization of the intractable joint likelihood for model training.

Della learns a series of layer-wise latent variables with each inferred from those of lower layers and tightly coupled with the hidden states by low-rank tensor product. In this way, Della forces these posterior latent variables to be fused deeply with the whole computation path and hence incorporate more information. We theoretically demonstrate that our method can be regarded as entangling latent variables to avoid posterior information decrease through layers, enabling Della to get higher non-zero KL values even without any annealing or thresholding tricks.

However, sarcasm can also be expressed through contextual presumptions, background knowledge, and common sense. This paper introduces the ContextuAl SarCasm DEtector (CASCADE), which adopts a hybrid approach that combines content- and context-driven modeling for sarcasm detection in online social media discussions. CASCADE extracts contextual information from the discourse of discussion threads and utilizes user embeddings that encode stylometric and personality features of users. This approach results in a significant boost in classification performance when used in conjunction with content-based feature extractors, such as convolutional neural networks, on a large Reddit corpus.",

However, the task presents significant challenges, including encoding the meaning of natural language, decoding it into SQL queries, and translating the semantics between the two forms. Recent advances have addressed these challenges to varying degrees, but there is a lack of comprehensive surveys on the topic. This survey aims to fill that gap by reviewing recent progress in datasets, methods, and evaluations for text-to-SQL.

However, the computational complexity of a self-attention network is C-C-C, increasing quadratically with sequence length. By contrast, the complexity of LSTM-based approaches is only O(n). In practice, however, LSTMs are much slower to train than self-attention networks as they cannot be parallelized at sequence level: to model context, the current LSTM state relies on the full LSTM computation of the preceding state. This has to be computed n times for a sequence of length n. The linear transformations involved in the LSTM gate and state computations are the major cost factors in this. To enable sequence-level parallelization of LSTMs, we approximate full LSTM context modelling by computing hidden states and gates with the current input and a simple bag-of-words representation of the preceding tokens context. This allows us to compute each input step efficiently in parallel, avoiding the formerly costly sequential linear transformations. We then connect the outputs of each parallel step with computationally cheap element-wise computations. We call this the Highly Parallelized LSTM. To further constrain the number of LSTM parameters, we compute several small HPLSTMs in parallel like multi-head attention in the Transformer. The experiments show that our MHPLSTM decoder achieves significant BLEU improvements, while being even slightly faster than the self-attention network in training, and much faster than the standard LSTM.",

In this paper, we introduce DeCLUTR: a Deep Contrastive Learning approach for Unsupervised Textual Representations. Inspired by recent advancements in Deep Metric Learning (DML), we have designed a self-supervised objective for learning universal sentence embeddings without the need for labeled training data. Our approach, when used to extend the pre-training of transformer-based language models, narrows the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised pre-training for universal sentence encoders. Our experiments indicate that the quality of the learned embeddings improves with an increase in the number of trainable parameters and the amount of unlabeled training data. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly accessible and can be easily adapted to new domains or used to embed unseen text.",

        "text": "Unsupervised commonsense question answering is appealing since it does not rely on any labeled task data. Among existing work, a popular solution is to use pre-trained language models to score candidate choices directly conditioned on the question or context. However, such scores from language models can be easily affected by irrelevant factors, such as word frequencies, sentence structures, etc. These distracting factors may not only mislead the model to choose a wrong answer but also make it oversensitive to lexical perturbations in candidate answers. In this paper, we present a novel SEmantic-based Question Answering method (SEQA) for unsupervised commonsense question answering. Instead of directly scoring each answer choice, our method first generates a set of plausible answers with generative models (e.g., GPT-2), and then uses these plausible answers to select the correct choice by considering the semantic similarity between each plausible answer and each choice. We devise a simple, yet sound formalism for this idea and verify its effectiveness and robustness with extensive experiments. We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark datasets, and our method achieves the best results in unsupervised settings. Moreover, when attacked by TextFooler with synonym replacement, SEQA demonstrates much less performance drops than baselines, thereby indicating stronger robustness.",

Utilizing a learning-based mechanism, UniTrigger generates a fixed phrase that, when added to any benign inputs, can drop the prediction accuracy of a textual neural network (NN) model to near zero on a target class. To defend against this attack that can cause significant harm, in this paper, we borrow the “honeypot” concept from the cybersecurity community and propose DARCY, a honeypot-based defense framework against UniTrigger. DARCY greedily searches and injects multiple trapdoors into an NN model to “bait and catch” potential attacks.
